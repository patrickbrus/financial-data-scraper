# Financial Data Scraper
This side project aims at getting all relevant information of certain stocks I am interested using Python.

This project will grow over time with the aim to have an end-to-end ETL pipeline that regulardy loads the latest financial data and stores it so that I can access the latest financial data and maybe even create interesting dashboards using that data.
